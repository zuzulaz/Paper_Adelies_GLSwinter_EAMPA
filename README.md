Tracking data of Adélie penguins *(Pygoscelis adeliae)* used in the study are available from the Movebank repository (https://www.movebank.org/), study ID 4778411162.

The following code was used:
- R code to calculate kernel UD, repressentativness and site importance.
- R code to calculate kernel UD overlaps using Bhattacharyya affinity (BA) and Utilization distribution overlap index (UDOI).
- R code to calculate time spent within the East Antarctic Marine Protected Area (EAMPA) boundaries.
